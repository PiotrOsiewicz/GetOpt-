How to get going
----------------

1. `git clone https://github.com/PiotrOsiewicz/GetOptPlusPlus`
2. `cd GetOptPlusPlus`
3. `sudo make install`

Prequisites
-----------
This library is being developed on Linux and so I cannot guarantee that it will
work on other operating systems. It does not make use of any propriertary
system libraries.

It requires:

- C++11-compatible compiler.
- Criterion unit testing library (if running tests).
