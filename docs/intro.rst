Intent
------

*GetOpt++* is C++ library for command line argument parsing. Core values of the
project are:

- Performance
- Simplicity
- Clarity

Okay, enough of buzzwords - this library should be easy to deploy - performance
and documentation are secondary values (at least for the time being). Our
mission is to make life easier. Not neccessarily by coming up with something
mind-blowing.
